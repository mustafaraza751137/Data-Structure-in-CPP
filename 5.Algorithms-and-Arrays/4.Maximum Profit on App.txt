You will be provided with a list of size N having budgets of buyers and you need to return the maximum profit 
that you can earn. Lets say you decide that price of your app is Rs. x and there are N number of buyers. 
So maximum profit you can earn is :
 m * x

where m is total number of buyers whose budget is greater than or equal to x.
Input format :
Line 1 : N (No. of buyers)
Line 2 : Budget of buyers (separated by space)

Output Format :
 Maximum profit

Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6

Sample Input 1 :
4
30 20 53 14

Sample Output 1 :
60
