Chapter Assignment
Problem Statement: Tower of Hanoi
Problem Level: EASY
Problem Description:
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move all disks from source rod to destination rod using third rod (say auxiliary). The rules are :
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) A disk can be moved only if it is on the top of a rod.
3) No disk can be placed on the top of a smaller disk.

Print the steps required to move n disks from source rod to destination rod.
Source Rod is named as 'a', auxiliary rod as 'b' and destination rod as 'c'.
Input Format :
Integer n

Output Format :
Steps in different lines (in one line print source and destination rod name separated by space)
2
Constraints :
0 <= n <= 20

Sample Input 1 :
2

Sample Output 1 :
a b
a c
b c

Sample Input 2 :
3

Sample Output 2 :
a c
a b
c b
a c
b a
b c
a c

using namespace std;
void func(int n,char s,char d,char a){
	if(n==1){
		cout<<s<<" "<<d<<endl;
		return;
	}
	func(n-1,s,a,d);
		cout<<s<<" "<<d<<endl;
	func(n-1,a,d,s);
}
int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    func(n,'a','c','b');
	return 0;
